Project 9

Everything works.

ZachariaEricProject9 is a folder that contains the .jack files for the game Blob. The purpose of the game is to eat blob like food, 
without running into the ends of the screen or into any of the poisonous foods that slowly appear as you progress through the game. 
The blob is constantly moving linearly, and changes direction using the arrowkeys on your keyboard. 


Output file will have the same file name and location as the last folder name in the directory path, with extension ".asm"

Before playing the game on the VM emulator, the .jack files must be translated to .vm files, which can be done by typing this on the command line:

Windows: 
<filepath>/JackCompiler.bat <filepath>/src/ZachariaEricProject9

Mac OS:
<filepath>/JackCompiler.sh <filepath>/src/ZachariaEricProject9
